# RouteSetter

Installation:
- --- Cant upload so big file (rocks, holds etc..) so instead of Download 'RouteSetter.zip' from gitHub do:
- --- Download whole repo as zip, unzip the dir. Now you should have directory RouteSetter-master with addon files (.py files and more dictionaries)
- --- If you have for example RouteSetter-master/RouteSetter-master/ addon files remove one dir from the path, it is caused by unzip.
- --- Cosmetic thing rename RouteSetter-master to 
- --- Now zip the whole RouteSetter directory again and continue
- Open Blender
- Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons
- Click on 'Install...'
- Choose downloaded add-on file 
- Click on 'Install Add-on'
- Now you should see your addon in addon list
- Enable add on by check box
- Now you have installed and enabled addon
- You can find addon tab in 'N panel' of '3D viewport'
- '3D viewport' is the default viewport when you start Blender, by pressing N on you keyboard you hide/unhide 'N panel'
- Now when you are in right viewport by pressing N on you keyboard you unhide 'N panel'
- You should see some vertical tabs and one of them should be RouteSetter, probably the last one
- Click on the tab and you are ready to build
- Happy route setting!
